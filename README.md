# Docusaurus Boilerplate

This is a **pre-configured Docusaurus starter template** for i18n docs & posts using Docusaurus `v2.0.0-beta.9`, Typescript, Sass, Local Search etc.

A live demo build directly from this repository is deployed on [docusaurus-boilerplate.vercel.app](https://docusaurus-boilerplate.vercel.app) which means you can start a docs site exactly like the demo out of the box.

## This Template Is Currently `Working In Progress`

*do not fork this repo unless you are going to contribute, this WIP is under a lot of force pushes*

just `clone` or [Use This Template](https://github.com/arisac/docusaurus-starter-boilerplate-docs-only/generate)

### Quick start a local site

Multi-languages & local search are not available for dev server, so just start a build server using:

```bash
yarn
yarn build
npm run serve
```
