# Get Started

This is a **pre-configured Docusaurus starter template** for i18n docs & posts using Docusaurus `v2.0.0-beta.9`, Typescript, Sass, Local Search etc.

A live demo build directly from this repository is deployed on [docusaurus-boilerplate.vercel.app](https://docusaurus-boilerplate.vercel.app) which means you can start a docs site exactly like the demo out of the box.

You are viewing the latest version of the template demo and neccessary docs to help you quickly start a docs site. Try browse around this site to see the pre-configed features, full feature list can be find under [Boilerplate Features](./features.md)

## Quick Start this Template

To use this template, simply `clone` this repo or click [Use This Template](https://github.com/arisac/docusaurus-boilerplate/generate) with your Github account.

**Install dependencies**

```bash
yarn
```

**Run the development server**

```bash
yarn start
```

:::info

Multi-languages and Search feature will not work in dev mode.

They only work in build productions.

:::

** Build the production site **

```bash
yarn build
```

** Run the build site **

```bash

```

Now the site is running with full features of this template. Just like the demo on https://docusaurus-boilerplate.vercel.app.

## Let's Start to Setup Your Own

Nice, isn't it? Since this template has some plugins and settings pre-configured, it meets the most demands.

I believe you are ready to setup this template for your own use. Here's some well ordered guides to start:

## Quick Setup

This will guide you through necessary changes required to make this website as you desired, like change the site name, add/remove languanges etc.:

- [Basic Configurations](./quick-setup/basic.md)
- [Use A Homepage](./quick-setup/use-homepage.md)
- [Turn Off Blog](./quick-setup/turn-off-blog.md)
- [Translate Site](./quick-setup/translate-site.md)
- [Deploy Your Site](./quick-setup/deploy.md)

## Extras

If you finished the Quick Setup, and would like to learn more about Docusaurus, the Extras organized some docs from the Docusaurus Official Docs site.
